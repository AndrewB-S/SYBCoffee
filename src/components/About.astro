  <p>
    Good coffee is an art, and I love making it for people and teaching them how
    to make it, too. Throughout college I worked as a barista at several local
    cafes, and I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a Culinary,
    Sustainability, and Hospitality program degree. Although I have moved on
    from that profession, I still find myself wanting to return to the craft.
    That's where you come in.
