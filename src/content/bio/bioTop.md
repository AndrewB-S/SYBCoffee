Making coffee is an art. I love to make coffee for people, and I love to teach people how to make it. My passion for coffee started in college, while I worked as a barista at several cafes. I knew that quality coffee was something I wanted to share with others. While working as a barista, I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a Culinary, Sustainability, and Hospitality degree. After years of developing techniques at home and sharing them with friends, I opened a mobile coffee catering business. If you want to learn how to make the best cup of coffee at home, I offer lessons. I will personally evaluate your equipment and your coffee, and show you how to get the most out of what you have. I can teach you how to make a great cup of coffee too.
